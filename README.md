# library
This application was generated using JHipster 4.14.5, you can find documentation and help at [http://www.jhipster.tech/documentation-archive/v4.14.5](http://www.jhipster.tech/documentation-archive/v4.14.5).

## Development

Before you can build this project, you must install and configure the following dependencies on your machine:

1. [Node.js][]: We use Node to run a development web server and build the project.
   Depending on your system, you can install Node either from source or as a pre-packaged bundle.
2. [Yarn][]: We use Yarn to manage Node dependencies.
   Depending on your system, you can install Yarn either from source or as a pre-packaged bundle.

After installing Node, you should be able to run the following command to install development tools.
You will only need to run this command when dependencies change in [package.json](package.json).

    yarn install

We use yarn scripts and [Webpack][] as our build system.


Run the following commands in two separate terminals to create a blissful development experience where your browser
auto-refreshes when files change on your hard drive.

    ./mvnw
    yarn start

[Yarn][] is also used to manage CSS and JavaScript dependencies used in this application. You can upgrade dependencies by
specifying a newer version in [package.json](package.json). You can also run `yarn update` and `yarn install` to manage dependencies.
Add the `help` flag on any command to see how you can use it. For example, `yarn help update`.

The `yarn run` command will list all of the scripts available to run for this project.

## Using Docker to simplify development (optional)

You can use Docker to improve your JHipster development experience. A number of docker-compose configuration are available in the [src/main/docker](src/main/docker) folder to launch required third party services.

For example, to start a mysql database in a docker container, run:

    docker-compose -f src/main/docker/mysql.yml up -d

To stop it and remove the container, run:

    docker-compose -f src/main/docker/mysql.yml down

For more information refer to [Using Docker and Docker-Compose][], this page also contains information on the docker-compose sub-generator (`jhipster docker-compose`), which is able to generate docker configurations for one or several JHipster applications.

## Testing

To launch your application's tests, run:

    ./mvnw clean test

### Client tests

Unit tests are run by [Karma][] and written with [Jasmine][]. They're located in [src/test/javascript/](src/test/javascript/) and can be run with:

    yarn test



For more information, refer to the [Running tests page][].

## Building for production

To optimize the library application for production, run:

    ./mvnw -Pprod clean package

This will concatenate and minify the client CSS and JavaScript files. It will also modify `index.html` so it references these new files.
To ensure everything worked, run:

    java -jar target/*.war

Then navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.
